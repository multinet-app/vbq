# Visual Based Query

This is the Visual Based Query (VBQ) interface for the Multinet project.
It is a typescript multi-coordinated view, written using the Vue.js
framework, that allows users to visualize connectomics data hosted on a Multinet
instance.

## Quick Start

5. Copy .env.development to .env with `cp .env.development .env`
6. Install the Yarn dependencies: `yarn install`.
7. Run the application: `yarn serve`.

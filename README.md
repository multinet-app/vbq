# Visual Based Query

This is the Visual Based Query (VBQ) interface for the Multinet project.
It is a typescript multi-coordinated view, written using the Vue.js
framework, that allows users to visualize connectomics data hosted on a Multinet
instance.

## Quick Start

To get the application up and running in dev mode:

1. Ensure that you have Node and yarn installed.
2. Open Docker preferences and increase memory usage to at least 5GB.
3. Check out this repository and move into it (e.g., `cd vbq`).
4. Copy .env.development to .env with `cp .env.development .env`
5. Install the Yarn dependencies: `yarn install`.
6. Run the application: `yarn serve`.
